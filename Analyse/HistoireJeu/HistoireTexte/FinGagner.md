An astonishing event occurred yesterday at the Folter prison. A man called Patrick Signcaster was reported missing until now. For two weeks, the man had literally vanished. We had the opportunity to have a little discussion after his escape. He said : “I’ve never been so confused. It’s like if this was all a dream. I woke up one day, saw all those marks on the wall, as if I was there for several days ! But strangely I couldn’t remember anything. All of the sudden, there was this weird voice that told me “you have 15 minutes to escape or toxic gas will fill the place up “. I then start to panic. I immediately go out of this room I woke up in, but then go back in but it wasn’t the same room. At that point, I thought I lost it. Everything got blurry sometimes, nothing made sense. I could see threw walls, I saw weird handwritten notes, but somehow I managed to escape this hell on earth.” Doctors aren’t sure what really happened in there, but Patrick will sure be their test subject for multiple analysis. Friends, family and  colleagues were sure pleased to hear that their beloved Singcaster was alive. Historians and the government agreed to deny access to the public, considering this building a threat to humans. The events that occurred in that building will never be exposed properly.
