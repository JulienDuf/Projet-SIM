*Folter* was built during the 2nd world war. Rumours said that its main utility was to lock in Jews. Back in the 1940's, all of the troops were deployed on the battlefield. Because of their lack of personnel, they created this building of hell to prevent unguarded prisoners from leaving the premises. There isn't a lot of documentation since every archaeologist, scientific or journalist had a terrible experience and seem to have forgotten every aspect of this particular building.
