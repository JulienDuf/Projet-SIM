A man has been missing for the past two weeks. Patrick Singcaster, a 30 years old writer for *The Occult* newspaper, a journal that focused on paranormal events. The report was filed a week ago when his coworkers noticed that he didn't comeback from his latest trip. They said that on Sunday morning, he left his office heading to the airport with a ticket to Germany. He was supposed to investigate weird events and paranormal activities surrounding a building called *Folter*. They haven't been able to reach him and he was supposed to return last week. M. Singcaster is 5'11", weighs about 190 pounds, has brown curly hair and wears glasses. He always wears a checked shirt and blue jeans, often seen carrying around his trusty notepad. Anyone with information on the matter can contact the authorities at 450-444-1919.
