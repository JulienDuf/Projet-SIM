Last week, the German government decided to officially close the Folter due to paranormal activity. Yesterday was destruction day. Bull dowsers, wreaking balls and dynamite sticks were used to demolish that building for good. While picking up the debris, one person found some bones. Authorities were automatically contacted. The lab found DNA matches. One caught particularly our attention. His name was Patrick Singcaster. We just did a report on him two weeks ago. He was a nobody, nothing to tell on him. But media liked him and wondered actually what happened to him. Unfortunately we now have our answer, but that wasn’t the worst part. Authorities noticed a weird smell. Back-up was needed and the police called chemists. The diagnosis resulted a dangerous gas called Arsenic pentafluoride  which chemical formula is (AsF5). Arsenic pentafluoride is a colorless gas and has a trigonal bipyramidal structure. Arsenic pentafluoride is an extremely dangerous toxin, mainly poisoning liver cells. It has an apparent smell that is similar to vinyl chloride gas. It’s reaction is : AsF5 + SF4 → SF3+ + AsF6−. A Tragic event that will be hard to accept for the Singcaster family.
